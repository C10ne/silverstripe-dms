# Use in templates

Add a simple include to any of your `.ss` templates to display the DMSDocuments associated with
the current page on the front-end.

```
<% include DocumentSets %>
```

You can fine tune the HTML markup or display behaviour of any of the templates in `/dms/templates/Includes` to change
the way documents will be displayed in your project.
